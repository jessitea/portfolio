      			<p>Jessica Ticzon is a full-stack web developer, based in northern New Jersey.</p>  

      			<p>For the past 8 years of her life, she has worked as a dedicated registered nurse in a wide, variety of settings.  However, she has always been interested in technology and the endless possiblities that coding can provide.  So, to the shock of her family and (some) friends, she decided to do a career change into the fast-paced and exciting world of web development!</p>

      			<p>Jessica hopes to use her new skills for good by working with a non-profit or healthcare company to help improve the healthcare industry by helping to improve its technology.</p>

      			<p>When Jessica is not coding, she enjoys eating, cooking, photography and spending time with her family, fiance, and dog, Molly.</p>

      			<p><i>Technical Skills: Javascript, JQuery, MySQL, Mongo, React.js, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Materialize</i></p>
